 were you also wondering, what's the current status of the investment I had made in stocks? i was! so i made this app. this app takes some basic details such as stock name, stock purchase price & stock quantity you had purchased. then it fetches the current price of the stock from the [Alpha Advantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) & calculates overall profit or loss percent along with absolute profit or loss. ðŸ˜‡ lookout for the theme change ðŸ‘€
